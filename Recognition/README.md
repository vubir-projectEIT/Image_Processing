# Recognition

Recognize hand gestures and faces using opencv and mediapipe. 
In this module, we dive deeper into the recognition of humans in images so that they can interact with computers. 
We will understand how our computer can understand human attributes like hands and faces and how we can optimize this to interact with our computer in real time. 
We will look at the fastest and most powerful machine-learning models that are used for these tasks and learn how to process an image using those tools. 
What we can do with these results is up to you.

### Face

Train a machine learning model to recognize different people on the fly.
Investigate how local binary pattern histograms are used to encode the face of a human and how to train and run machine learning models.

### Hand

Use a state-of-the-art hand detection and hand gesture recognition model developed by Google.
Investigate more advanced machine learning models like deep learning and neural networks.
