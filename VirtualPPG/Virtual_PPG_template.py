Important message for the developer:

This is a template for making a virtual heart rate sensor, also refered to as a virtual PPG (why would that be? ðŸ¤”).
We already give you some helper functions to detect faces in images. 
If you are interested, you can check the implementation in the corresponinding file (see imports).
Now it is up to you, follow the guide and extract the heart rate from a video of your face.
Good luck!
