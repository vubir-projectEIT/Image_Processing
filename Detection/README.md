# Detection module

Detect objects, colors, edges, faces, people, and much more using opencv. 
In this module, we will explore pure image processing and attempt to detect stuff in raw images. 
We will look at different techniques to detect shapes, colors, or more complex features in images to create programs that can understand what they see. 
We will learn simple but very powerful techniques that an engineer can use to process an image and more complex tools, like machine learning models, to perform more difficult tasks. 
After the image is processed, you can use the results further in any application.

### [Blob detection](https://github.com/LorisGiordano/ProjectEIT-Image-processing-toolbox/edit/main/Detection/Blob)

Create and test different detectors for blobs in images and extract objects of interest by their shape.
Explore the simple blob detector of Opencv, and set the parameters to detect any blob accurately.

### [Color detection](https://github.com/LorisGiordano/ProjectEIT-Image-processing-toolbox/edit/main/Detection/Colour)

Create filters for different colors in images and visualize objects of surfaces by their color.
Investigate how computers see color and how to make your computer see the colors you want it to see.

### [Depth detection](https://github.com/LorisGiordano/ProjectEIT-Image-processing-toolbox/edit/main/Detection/Depth)

Go from 2D to 3D view by incorporating depth information into color images. 
Learn how depth images are created and how to combine them with color images to get 3D color representations of the space.

### [Edge detection](https://github.com/LorisGiordano/ProjectEIT-Image-processing-toolbox/edit/main/Detection/Edge)

Extract edges from the image and discover the concept of optical flow.
Discover how to simplify and image represented by millions of pixels using simple concepts of image processing.

### [Eye and face detection](https://github.com/LorisGiordano/ProjectEIT-Image-processing-toolbox/edit/main/Detection/Eye_and_face)

Use specialized machine-learning-based image filters to detect eyes and faces in images.
Explore the Haar cascade classifier, what it does, and how it can be used.

### [People detection](https://github.com/LorisGiordano/ProjectEIT-Image-processing-toolbox/edit/main/Detection/People)

Create a simple program for detecting people in images. 
Explore the HOG description and how simple machine learning models can use this description to identify people.
