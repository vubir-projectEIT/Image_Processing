"""
The threading library contains a number of objects which allow for concurrent-like behaviour of python code.
We say "concurrent-like" because Python utilizes a global interpreter lock to manage execution of code;
GIL allows only one instruction at a time by locking the interpreter which effectively makes Python single-threaded.

Normally this is not an issue and even has advantages such as shared memory. If true multithreading is needed
check ot the MultiProcessing library, which has a nearly identical API, although memory space is not shared.

Typical use cases threading include:
    Sensor polling at a set interval
    Long running processing tasks, ie. image processing
    Rest servers
"""

from threading import Thread, Lock
import time

'''
Import the threading library:
The Thread wraps any method as a background task which share memory within the main thread scope

The Lock allows for the synchronization of memory access between the main thread and the background threads
    Thread 1 will lock data['value'] so no other thread can access it while it remains locked
    Thread 1 will get the value of the data to manipulate: 0 <-- data['value']
    Thread 1 will increment the value of the memory 0 + 1 --> data['value'] == 1
    Thread 1 will release the lock, and allow Thread 2 to now lock data['value'] 
    Thread 2 will get the value of the data to manipulate: 1 <-- data['value']
    Thread 2 will decrement the value of the memory 1 - 1 --> data['value'] == 0
    
Try removing the 'with lock:' statement from the two functions below to observe a "race condition".
    Thread 1 will get the value of the data to manipulate: 0 <-- data['value']
    Thread 2 will get the value of the data to manipulate: 0 <-- data['value']
    Thread 1 will increment the value of the memory 0 + 1 --> data['value'] == 1
    Thread 2 will decrement the value of the memory 0 - 1 --> data['value'] == -1
